### 💡 Why Digital Marketing Matters

#### ✅ 1. **Global Reach, Local Precision**
Target anyone, anywhere — but still reach your exact audience using smart filters like location, age, interests, and behavior.

#### ✅ 2. **Data-Driven Decisions**
Unlike traditional marketing, digital lets you *track everything* — from who clicked your ad to which headline worked better.

#### ✅ 3. **Affordable for All**
Whether you have $100 or $10,000, digital marketing gives you tools to run campaigns at scale or on a shoestring.

#### ✅ 4. **Build Relationships, Not Just Sales**
With consistent content, email nurturing, and social interaction — digital marketing helps brands build trust and loyalty.
